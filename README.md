# Rocket-Launch-Nonlinear-Optimization-AMPL
A project in maximising the launch height of a rocket using AMPL mathematical modelling software, by means of modelling this an a non-linear optimization problem and employing a variety of solvers to generate solutions.  We then discuss the sensibility of the solutions generated in the report.
