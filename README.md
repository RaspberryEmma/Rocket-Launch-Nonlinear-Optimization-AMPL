# Rocket-Launch-Nonlinear-Optimization-AMPL
A project in maximising the launch height of a rocket using AMPL mathematical modelling software, by means of modelling this an a non-linear optimization problem and employing a variety of solvers to generate solutions.  We then discuss the sensibility of the solutions generated in the report.

After loading the given files into AMPL, one may use the command "include cw1.run;" or "include cw1_verbose.run;" to see the solutions being generated.
